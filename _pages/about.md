I am a PhD student at the ELLIS [Robot Learning Lab](https://rl.uni-freiburg.de/) at the University of Freiburg. My
research interests are focused on reinforcement learning, embodied AI and robotics, though much more broadly I am
interested in topics including, but not limited to, decision making, planning and multi-agent systems.

In the past I have worked across all aspects of autonomous agents and their environments. After studying economics
and working in econometric forecasting in Switzerland, I graduated on the Dean's List of the MSc Computational Statistics and Machine Learning at University College London. I then
developed novel decentralised systems and consensus protocols before I flipped the coin and started to optimise agent's behaviours within
an environment during my PhD.
