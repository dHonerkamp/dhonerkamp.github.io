I am a PhD student at the ELLIS [Robot Learning Lab](https://rl.uni-freiburg.de/) at the University of Freiburg. My
research interests are focused on reinforcement learning, embodied AI and robotics, though much more broadly I am
interested in a broad range of topics such as decision making, planning, multi-agent systems among others.

In the past I have been working across all aspects of autonomous agents and their environments. After studying economics
and working in econometric forecasting I studied machine learning and reinforcement learning at University College
London, graduating from the MSc Computational Statistics and Machine Learning with Dean's List honors. I then first
developed decentralised systems and consensus protocols before flipping the coin and starting to optimise agent's within
an environment.  

Note that the remainder of this site is still WIP.

[//]: # (Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown &#40;.md&#41;, YAML &#40;.yml&#41;, HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages]&#40;https://pages.github.com/&#41; service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.)
