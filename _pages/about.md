I am a PhD student at the ELLIS [Robot Learning Lab](https://rl.uni-freiburg.de/) at the University of Freiburg. My
research interests are focused on reinforcement learning, embodied AI and robotics, though much more broadly I am
interested in topics including, but not limited to, decision making, planning and multi-agent systems.

In the past I have worked across all aspects of autonomous agents and their environments. After studying economics
and working in econometric forecasting in Switzerland, I graduated on the Dean's List of the MSc Computational Statistics and Machine Learning at University College London. I then
developed novel decentralised systems and consensus protocols before I flipped the coin and started to optimise agent's behaviours within
an environment during my PhD.  

Note that the remainder of this site is still WIP. Until then please refer to my [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ian_c5AAAAAJ&hl=en) and [university profile page](https://rl.uni-freiburg.de/people/honerkamp) for recent works.

The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown &#40;.md&#41;, YAML &#40;.yml&#41;, HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages]&#40;https://pages.github.com/&#41; service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.)
